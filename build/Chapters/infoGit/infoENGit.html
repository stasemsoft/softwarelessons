<h4>0.0.0.1. What is Git?</h4>
<p>
Git is created to have distributed version control.
Serious software development is not possible without using
some sort of version management.
It allows you to get back to a specific version
and it enables people to work together on 1 software system.
</p>
<p>
This Chapter gives first time users a short intro into git.
For a lot more info please look at the very good book
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2</a>
which is free to download.

<h4>0.0.0.2. Create a repository</h4>

<p>
A repository is a place (typically online) where your code and
all previous versions of it are stored. We will now create a repository at
the so-called <em>git-lab</em> environment at FHICT
(only available for FHICT-students;
An alternative would be creating a repository at <em>GitHub.com</em>,
which is very similar)
</p>
<p>
Use a browser to go to
<a href="https://git.fhict.nl">https://git.fhict.nl</a>
and create a git repository.
Copy the https-url to your clipboard, we need it in a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
In Git you typically have a <code>repository</code> on a network somewhere where
all files of your project are stored, including the history of
<code>commits</code> to those files.
Furthermore you have a  <code>local repository</code> with all source code versions
which you regularly <code>synchronize</code> (using <code>push</code> and <code>pull</code>) with
the remote repository on a server.
Other people in your team sync with the same remote repository.
</p>
<p>
Advanced uses like <code>branching</code> and <code>tagging</code> we will not use in this course.
</p>
</section><section>
<h4>0.0.0.3. Clone the repository</h4>
<p>
Next step is creating a so-called <code>clone</code> locally on your laptop.
This will be your workspace where you can develop.
By keeping it up to date with the server
(<code>pushing</code> your changes to the server
and <code>pulling</code> the changes of other developers from the server)
you can work together with other developers.
</p>
<p>
You can choose between several <em>tools</em> to do the <code>pulling</code>
and <code>pushing</code>,
some created to be easy to use and some more advanced.
We will use the <em>command line</em>: the advantages being that <strong>all</strong>
<code>git</code>-functionality is available from the command line and
virtually every user using <code>git</code> has this commandline installed.
The syntax shown here is that of a Unix-command line (terminal or bash),
which is the same for every Unix, Linux or Mac user.
If you only have MS-Windows you could install <em>cygwin</em>
or adjust the commands a little.
</p>
<p>
Start a <em>terminal</em> or <em>bash</em> shell.
Go to the <code>directory</code> (<em>folder</em>) where you want you workspace to be.
How?
Suppose you want to create a directory (<code>mkdir</code> means <em>make dir</em>)
<em>myProject</em> in your <em>Documents</em> <code>directory</code>
you type the commands:
</p><figure><pre><code>cd Documents
mkdir myProject
cd myProject</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>
<code>cd</code> is short for <em>Change Dir</em>.
Most of the time you don't have to type whole names like <em>Documents</em>:
just type <em>Doc</em> and
press the <em>tab</em> key and probably the <em>shell</em> will complete the name.
</p>
<p>

	<figcaption>bash</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
In the <code>terminal</code> <em>clone</em> the git-repository from the server
to your local directory by typing:
</p><figure><pre><code>git clone &lt;pasteYourGitUrlHere&gt;</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>
After that (you will be asked for your <em>username</em>/<em>password</em>)
you now have a local copy (<em>clone</em>) of the entire history of this repository
(for a just created project this is still empty of course).
</p>
<p>
To go inside the local <em>repository-directory</em>,
which after a <em>clone</em> contains the <em>latest</em> version of the files,
use
</p><figure><pre><code>cd &lt;dirname&gt;</code></pre><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Typing <code>git status</code> tells you that (at this moment)
there’s nothing to commit (which means you don't have made local changes
to the repository).
</p>

<p>
These are only the basics of <em>git</em>.
In my experience most students use it to <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> their
changes right from their <code>IDE</code>. Most <em>IDEs</em> and <em>editors</em> nowadays
have built-in <code>git</code>-functionality.
Say for example you use Xcode: see xcode-menu ‘Source Control’:
when you succeeded with the above doing the same from xcode
should be a piece of cake! Good luck!
</p>
